# üîê Data Security Algorithms (C#)

This project was developed as part of a **college Data Security course**. It includes the implementation of various classical and modern **encryption and decryption algorithms** built **entirely from scratch in C#**.  
The main goal of the project is to **deeply understand how these cryptographic techniques work** by implementing them manually rather than relying on libraries.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Classical Ciphers
- Caesar Cipher
- Monoalphabetic Cipher
- PlayFair Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Columnar Cipher
- Repeating Key Vigen√®re Cipher
- Autokey Vigen√®re Cipher

### Modern Encryption Algorithms
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)
- ElGamal Encryption
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Purpose
To gain hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms by implementing them manually and understanding how each step of the encryption and decryption process works.
